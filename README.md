# Terrible_PRNG
A VERY bad pseudorandom number generator. 

I will accept any and all pull requests that only change the integer values assigned to the variables defined in lines 8 through 11 of terrible_prng.py

Do not use this implementation for security-critical applications.


Also, I have 520 openings for web development roles I'm looking to fill. Minimum qualifications are 10^40 years experience and 10^(10^20) references. Send your application to quintin.pope.hiring@gmail.com

Indicate which of the openings you're applying to in your application (e.g., "Web Dev #237").
